# Run Tests via Copilot Studio Kit

Run a batch test suite against a **published** Copilot Studio agent using the [Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-CAT-Copilot-Studio-Kit).

## Prerequisites

The user must have:
1. The **[Copilot Studio Kit](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-CAT-Copilot-Studio-Kit)** installed in their Power Platform environment
2. **Published** their agent in the Copilot Studio UI
3. **Created a test set** in the Copilot Studio Kit
4. An **Azure App Registration** with Dataverse permissions

## Phase 1: Configure Settings

1. **Read `tests/settings.json`** (relative to the user's project CWD) and check for missing or placeholder values (containing `YOUR_`).

2. **If the file doesn't exist**, create it from the template:
   ```bash
   cp "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../tests/settings-example.json" ./tests/settings.json
   ```

3. **If values are missing**, ask the user for each missing value. Explain where to find each one:

   - **Environment URL** (`dataverse.environmentUrl`): "What is your Dataverse environment URL? Find it in Power Platform admin center or Copilot Studio > Settings > Session Details. It looks like `https://orgXXXXXX.crm.dynamics.com`"
   - **Tenant ID** (`dataverse.tenantId`): "What is your Azure tenant ID? Find it in Azure Portal > Microsoft Entra ID > Overview. It's a GUID like `c87f36f7-fc65-453c-9019-0d724f21bc42`"
   - **Client ID** (`dataverse.clientId`): "What is your App Registration client ID? Find it in Azure Portal > App Registrations > your app > Application (client) ID. It's a GUID."
   - **Agent Configuration ID** (`testRun.agentConfigurationId`): "What is your agent configuration ID? In Copilot Studio, go to your agent > Tests tab. The ID is a GUID found in the URL or test configuration."
   - **Test Set ID** (`testRun.agentTestSetId`): "What is your test set ID? In Copilot Studio, go to your agent > Tests tab > select your test set. The ID is a GUID found in the URL."

   Ask for ALL missing values at once (don't ask one at a time).

4. **Write `tests/settings.json`** with the collected values:
   ```json
   {
     "dataverse": {
       "environmentUrl": "<value>",
       "tenantId": "<value>",
       "clientId": "<value>"
     },
     "testRun": {
       "agentConfigurationId": "<value>",
       "agentTestSetId": "<value>"
     }
   }
   ```

5. If all values are already configured and valid, proceed to Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Run Tests

1. **Install dependencies** from the plugin's own manifest (never from the project's `tests/package.json`). Run exactly this single command, with no additional shell variables, `&&`/`||` chains or existence checks; it is fast when the dependencies are already installed. Lifecycle scripts are disabled on purpose:
   ```bash
   npm install --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund --prefix "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../tests"
   ```

2. **Confirm the configuration with the user before signing in.** `tests/settings.json` in the project decides which app registration and which environment the user is asked to sign in to, and it may have come from a cloned repository. Print what will be used:
   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../tests/run-tests.js" --config-dir ./tests --print-config
   ```
   Then decide:
   - **Already confirmed:** if the request you were given states that the user already confirmed these exact values (environmentUrl, tenantId and clientId) and all three match what was just printed, do not ask again. Continue with step 3.
   - **Otherwise, stop and ask.** You run as a forked sub-agent with no memory of earlier turns, so the user's answer reaches your caller, not you. End your turn with only this message and do nothing else (no sign-in, no test run):

     > Please confirm before I sign in and run the tests: environmentUrl=`<value>`, tenantId=`<value>`, clientId=`<value>`. Sign in and run the tests against this environment with this app registration? If yes, re-invoke this skill with exactly this in the request: "user confirmed environmentUrl=`<value>`, tenantId=`<value>`, clientId=`<value>`". If no, ask the user for the correct values and go back to Phase 1.

   - If the request says the user confirmed but any value differs from the printed one, treat it as not confirmed and stop with the message above using the printed values.
   - If the user typed all three values themselves in the request during Phase 1, that also counts as confirmed.

3. **Run the test script in the background** with a 100-minute timeout (6000000ms):
   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../tests/run-tests.js" --config-dir ./tests
   ```
   Use `run_in_background: true` for this command. Save the returned task ID.

4. **Wait 10 seconds**, then check the background task output (non-blocking check).

5. **Detect the authentication state** from the output:

   - If the output contains **"Using cached token"**: Authentication succeeded automatically. Tell the user: "Authentication successful (cached credentials). Tests are running, this may take several minutes..."

   - If the output contains **"use a web browser to open the page"**: Extract the URL and device code from the message. **Present this prominently to the user**:

     > **Authentication Required**
     >
     > Open your browser to: https://microsoft.com/devicelogin
     > Enter the code: **XXXXXXXXX** (extract the actual code from the output)
     >
     > After signing in, the tests will continue automatically.

   - If the output contains an **error**: Report the error to the user and stop.

   - If the output is empty or incomplete: Wait another 10 seconds and check again (retry up to 3 times).

6. **Wait for the background task to complete** (blocking). The script polls every 20 seconds until all tests finish and downloads results as a CSV.

7. **Read the final output** to get the success rate and CSV filename.

8. Proceed to **Phase 3**.

## Phase 3: Analyze Results

1. **Get the results**: `Glob: tests/test-results-*.csv` — read the most recent CSV file (newest by modification time).

2. **Parse the CSV columns**:
   | Column | Meaning |
   |--------|---------|
   | Test Utterance | The user message that was tested |
   | Expected Response | What the test expected |
   | Response | What the agent actually responded |
   | Latency (ms) | Response time |
   | Result | `Success`, `Failed`, `Unknown`, `Error`, or `Pending` |
   | Test Type | `Response Match`, `Topic Match`, `Generative Answers`, `Multi-turn`, `Plan Validation`, or `Attachments` |
   | Result Reason | Why the test passed or failed |

3. **Focus on failed tests** (Result = `Failed` or `Error`). For each failure, analyze:
   - **Test Type = Topic Match**: The wrong topic was triggered, or no topic matched. Check trigger phrases and model descriptions.
   - **Test Type = Response Match**: The response didn't match expected. Check `SendActivity` messages, instructions, or generative answer config.
   - **Test Type = Generative Answers**: The generative answer was incorrect or missing. Check knowledge sources, `SearchAndSummarizeContent`, and agent instructions.
   - **Test Type = Plan Validation**: The orchestrator's plan was wrong. Check topic descriptions and agent-level instructions.
   - **Test Type = Multi-turn**: A multi-turn conversation failed. Check topic flow, variable handling, and conditions.

4. Proceed to **Phase 4** (Propose Fixes).

## Phase 4: Propose Fixes

1. **For each failure, identify the relevant YAML file(s)**:
   - Auto-discover the agent: `Glob: **/agent.mcs.yml`
   - Find the relevant topic by matching the test utterance against trigger phrases and model descriptions
   - Read the topic file to understand the current flow

2. **Propose specific YAML changes** to fix each failure. Present them to the user as a summary:
   - Which test(s) failed and why
   - Which file(s) need changes
   - What the proposed change is (show the diff)

3. **Wait for user decision**. The user can:
   - **Accept all** — apply all proposed changes
   - **Accept partially** — apply only some changes (ask which ones)
   - **Reject** — discard proposed changes and discuss alternative approaches

4. **Apply accepted changes** using the Edit tool. After applying, remind the user to push and publish again before re-running tests.
