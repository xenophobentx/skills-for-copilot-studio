# Skills for Copilot Studio

A plugin for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot), and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that enables authoring, testing, and troubleshooting [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://aka.ms/CopilotStudio) **STANDARD** agents through YAML files — directly from your terminal or editor.

Looking for the plugin for GitHub Copilot harness agents? See the [New Microsoft Copilot Studio Plugin](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-studio-plugin). If you open a CLI agent workspace here (`template: cliagent-*` or `authoringModel: CliCopilot` in its `settings.mcs.yml`), the plugin is instructed to detect it, only read and describe it (no edits, pull, push or publish), and point you to that plugin.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot), or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Copilot Studio Extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilotstudio) (required for push/pull/clone operations)

## Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add microsoft/skills-for-copilot-studio
/plugin install copilot-studio@skills-for-copilot-studio
```

## Updating

The update process depends on how you installed the plugin:

| Interface | Update Method | Details |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Claude Code CLI** | Auto-update (recommended) | Marketplace plugins update automatically. No action needed. |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | Manual | Run `/plugin update skills-for-copilot-studio` in an interactive session, or `copilot plugin update skills-for-copilot-studio` from the terminal. |
| **VS Code** | Extension auto-update | VS Code handles updates automatically when extension auto-update is enabled in settings. |

## Usage

The plugin provides four sub-agents, each backed by a specialized agent:

```
/copilot-studio:copilot-studio-manage       Clone, push, pull, and sync agent content between local files and the cloud
/copilot-studio:copilot-studio-author       Create and edit YAML (topics, actions, knowledge, triggers, variables)
/copilot-studio:copilot-studio-test         Test published agents — point-tests, batch suites, or evaluation analysis
/copilot-studio:copilot-studio-advisor Design guidance, agent review, and troubleshooting
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone an agent from the cloud (guided flow — opens browser for sign-in)
/copilot-studio:copilot-studio-manage clone

# Design and build topics
/copilot-studio:copilot-studio-author Create a topic that handles IT service requests

# Pull latest, push your changes
/copilot-studio:copilot-studio-manage pull
/copilot-studio:copilot-studio-manage push

# Publish in Copilot Studio UI, then test
/copilot-studio:copilot-studio-test Send "How do I request a new laptop?" to the published agent

# Get design advice and review
/copilot-studio:copilot-studio-advisor Review my agent for improvements and known pitfalls
```
